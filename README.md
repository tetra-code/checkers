# Checkers
This is a simple game of checkers or draughts. It can be played in both singleplayer and multiplayer mode.

# Used dependencies
- Node.JS
- Express
- Nodemon (developing tool)

# How to run
This is a web application based checkers game. Thus there must be a running server to handle the broadcasting of moved checker pieces, but it is super easy to do it!

1. Open up a terminal
2. Clone the repository on to your local machine
3. Change your directory onto the project folder
4. Type 'npm start' which will fire up the server
5. If your environment variables are customized, the port number may be different but in default it is 3000
6. Type in "localhost:3000" on the browser and have fun!


# Personal note
I only had 48 hours to create a working prototype. The majority of my efforts were spent on the backend infrastructure logic and the game domain logic. Therefore the UI design is not my best work. Nevertheless it works flawlessly and I am still proud of myself that I made this in a short period of time.

I will constantly push new commits of improved UI design so that it is more fun to play with.

In addition, this project will later be hosted on a hosting service, so you will be able to play the game even without cloning this repository.
