            1. The goal is to jump the opponent's piece and remove them from the board.
            <br>
            2. You can only move diagonally forward, with the exception of the king.
            <br>
            3. When jumping an opponent's piece, you can do so backwards.
            <br>
            4. You can't jump more than once in a turn.
            <br>
            5. If a piece has the opportunity to jump, it must take the jump.
            <br>
            6. If a piece reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a king and it can move diagonally backwards.
            <br>
            7. To win you have to take all of the opponent's pieces.
            <br>
            8. If neither players can move, it is a draw.
